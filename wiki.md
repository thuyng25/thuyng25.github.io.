Matcha is a finely ground powder made from specially grown green tea leaves. It has deep roots in Japanese culture and has recently become popular worldwide for its unique flavor, and vibrant color . This wiki introduces the history, preparation, and cultural significance of matcha. 

## Section 1: History of Matcha
Matcha originated in China during the Tang Dynasty but became highly popular in Japan during the 12th century. It is closely tied to the Japanese **tea ceremony**, which emphasizes mindfulness, respect, and aesthetics. Over time, matcha shifted from being used mainly in rituals to becoming part of daily life and global café culture.

## Section 2: Preparation and Use 
Traditional preparation involves whisking matcha powder with hot water using a bamboo whisk either in usucha or koicha style. Today, it’s enjoyed in many forms but especially popular to prepares with milk and desserts. 

### Commonly Used Tools
- **Chawan**: tea bowl
- **Chasen**: bamboo whisk
- **Chashaku**: bamboo scoop 

## Section 3: Matcha in Global Markets 
Many of the most respected matcha producers are still based in Japan — for example, **Marukyu Koyamaen**, a Japanese farm in Kyoto, continues to supply high-quality ceremonial matcha, but growing global demand has outpaced domestic production. As a result, more matcha is now being sourced from **other regions such as China**, where larger farms can scale production more quickly. This expansion makes matcha more accessible worldwide, but it also raises questions about quality standards, authenticity, and the preservation of traditional farming methods.
